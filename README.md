#  Hi there 👋, I'm Joey!
My name is Joseph Halloran and I am a recent graduate with a Master's in Scientific Computation and Applied Mathematics.

My first language is **C++**, but I’ve explored many others during my bachelor's and master's studies:
- **Python** – data analysis & machine learning (Pandas, NumPy, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and more)  
- **C++ / Python / MATLAB** – scientific computing projects  
- **MATLAB / Python** – advanced mathematical programming & simulations
- **Fortran** – parallel programming with MPI, OpenMP, and SLURM  

I enjoy tackling challenging problems, writing clean code, and finding new ways to make computations faster and smarter.

## Fun facts  

- Competitive gamer turned programmer 🎮➡️💻  
- Tried optimizing with shared memory in CUDA… ended up slower on my PC (it was my PC's fault I swear) 😅 
- I’ve coded on both **Windows**🪟😬  and **Linux**  🐧🚀
