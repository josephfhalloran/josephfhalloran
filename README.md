#  Hi there 👋, I'm Joey!
My name is Joseph Halloran and I am a recent graduate with a Master's in Scientific Computation and Applied Mathematics.

My first language is **C++**, but I’ve explored many others during my bachelor's and master's studies:
- **Python** – data analysis & machine learning (Pandas, NumPy, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and more)  
- **C++ / Python / MATLAB** – scientific computing projects  
- **MATLAB / Python** – advanced mathematical programming & simulations
- **Fortran** – parallel programming with MPI, OpenMP, and SLURM  

I enjoy tackling challenging problems, writing clean code, and finding new ways to make computations faster and smarter.
